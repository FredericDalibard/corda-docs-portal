title: Write flows
---

This tutorial guides you through writing the three flows you need in your CorDapp. These are:

* `CreateAndIssueAppleStamp` flow
* `PackageApples` flow
* `RedeemApples` flow

You will be creating these flows in the `workflows/src/main/java/com/tutorial/flows` directory in this tutorial. Refer to the `TemplateInitiator.java` and `TemplateResponder.java` files in this directory to see template initiator and responder flows.

## Learning objectives

After you have completed this tutorial, you will know how to write and implement flows in a CorDapp.

## Before you start

Before you start writing flows, read [Key concepts: Flows](../../../../../platform/corda/4.8/open-source/key-concepts-flows.md).
