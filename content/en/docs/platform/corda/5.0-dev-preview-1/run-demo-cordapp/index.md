You can deploy a test CorDapp and use it to 'send rockets into space'. This simple CorDapp shows you how the Node HTTPS works to commence flows, and how the network responds in the Corda 5 Dev Preivew.

This demo is designed to be used locally, but you can replicate remote control of nodes using Postman or Swagger UI for HTTP methods.
