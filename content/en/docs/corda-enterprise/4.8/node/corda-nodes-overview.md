A Corda node is an entity in a Corda network that usually represents one party in a business network. Corda nodes are operated by one party and contain the CorDapps that the party uses to interact with other peers on the network.

## What makes up a node?

Nodes are represent parties in a network, hosting and managing the operation of all CorDapps the party uses to interact with other nodes. Each node runs within a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and has a unique identifier and a public address that serves as an endpoint for communication with other nodes in the network. Nodes are identified by an X.509 name called `myLegalName` and a key pair. The node legal name can be used to look up the node's information in the network map.

The key node components and services are:

* CorDapps
* A node configuration file
* The node database
* The Corda firewall
* Node services

### The node configuration file

The node configuration file is a single Human-Optimized Config Object Notation (HOCON) file that controls many aspects of a node. Node configuration files are hosted in the root node directory, and must be configured before the node can be started.

An exhaustive list of node configuration options and defaults can be found in the [Node configuration reference](setup/corda-configuration-fields.md/) documentation, and an example configuration file can be found in the [Node configuration](setup/corda-configuration-file.md/) documentation.

### CorDapps

CorDapps solve specific problems using the Corda framework. CorDapps are stored on Corda nodes and executed on the Corda network. From the perspective of a node operator, CorDapps are the functional element of Corda that define the operations and interactions of a business network.

CorDapps are installed on a node as `.jar` files located in the `cordapps` directory. For information on building and installing CorDapps on a node, see the [Building and installing CorDapps](../cordapps/cordapp-build-systems.md/) documentation.

### Node database

All nodes require a relational SQL database to store operational data and the Corda vault. The vault is a set of tables that store states and transaction data.

Corda supports a variety of node databases, for specific information about which databases are supported, see the [Platform support matrix](../platform-support-matrix.md/).

The node database also stores operational information for the node captured or generated by the node services, including:

* Flow checkpoints: These allow flows to be recovered if
* Metering

### Corda firewall

The primary function of the firewall is to act as an application-level firewall and protocol break on all internet-facing endpoints. The firewall is made up of two components, the float and the bridge. The float handles inbound connections, while the bridge handles outbound connections.

The float safeguards the node by acting as the point of contact for all other parties. The float exposes a port and an address that can be connected to by other parties on the network. When other parties connect to the float, the messages are bundled in the float and transmitted to the bridge across an internal firewall.

The bridge is the internal component of the firewall. It initiates all connections to the float, and runs health checks on the message bundles it receives before adding them to the node's Artemis queue.

### Node services

Nodes contain a number of services that support the operation of Corda business networks.


## Node communication protocols

Nodes communicate with other nodes using asynchronous AMQP/TLS 1.2 protocols. HTTP communication is used for the initial registration of a node on a network, and for sharing the node address locations via the network map. JDBC is used for communications between the node and the vault.

RPC calls are used to communicate between a client application and a node.

## Typical node deployments

In most cases, nodes are deployed with a firewall
