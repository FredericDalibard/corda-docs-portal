The Corda CLI is a command line tool which provides tooling for working with Corda clusters.
The [CSDE](content\en\platform\corda\5.0-dev-preview-2\getting-started\cordapp-standard-development-environment\csde.html) can handle standard calls to the Corda CLI.
However, if you prefer, you can perform command line instructions directly, as described in this section.
Installing the Corda CLI is described [here](../../getting-started/installing-corda-cli.html) in the Getting Started section.
