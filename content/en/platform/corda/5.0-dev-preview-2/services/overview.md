Corda Services are classes that provide methods to both flows and other Corda Services. Each service and method allows flows and Corda Services to perform specific functions.

In technical terms, a Corda Service is any class that needs to be a long-lived singleton that can be injected into flows and other services via the @CordaInject dependency injection mechanism. You can use them to create classes external to flows where you can logically group code that isnâ€™t directly related to the execution of a flow.
