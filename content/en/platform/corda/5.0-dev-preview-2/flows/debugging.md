**
As a CorDapp developer,
I want to be able to debug my flows in the development environment, including setting breakpoints in the CorDapp code, CorDapp tests and Corda Code. I want to be able to see the stack variables at the break point.
(Any other tools?)
So that I can quickly identify problems in my code.
