*Do we want to highlight differences with Corda 4? briefly mention future features?*

What is Corda 5???
multi-tenancy - host multiple virtual nodes on one deployment of Corda - enabled by sandboxing
cross-ref to architecture section
* a more application centric model. - optimising the platform around a user journey that starts from the developer and puts applications at the center, rather than starting layering abstractions starting from the node and working our way up to a business network.
* Applications networks are now simplified Corda networks. They are still permissioned and the run time responsibilities of membership management moves from a dedicated series of services (Corda Enterprise Network Manager) to a simple, extensible application running on a node â€” removing the need to run dedicated infrastructure to manage a network of peers. Previous versions of Corda focused on building an ecosystem of networks. Corda 5 is application-focused, making it easier to build, test, and distribute CorDapps.
* We have rewritten our APIs to be interface-based and modular.

An intro to the basics needed to get started with Corda 5.
* Prerequisites
* Installing Corda

A Corda Network is a peer-to-peer network of Nodes, each representing a party on the network. These Nodes run Corda applications (CorDapps) , and transact between Nodes using public or confidential identities.
Corda 5 features a fully redundant, worker-based architecture to be applied to all critical services that are required to run a node. We use a Kafka cluster as the message broker to facilitate communication between node services.

Corda 5 Developer Preview (DP) 2 is a developer preview of the next major iteration of Corda, Corda 5. While this version enables you to solve the same problems as Corda 4, the new Corda 5 architecture and deployment methods are designed to deliver high availability and scalability.
