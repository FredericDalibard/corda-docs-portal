# Internationalization

Hugo supports internationalization (i18n), the content for each language is stored in a 2 or 3 char ISO 639 code.

Therefore documentation for a particular language will be found in `/content/<lang>`, for example `/content/fr`.

Any translations found are presented in a dropdown that will appear in the top right corner of the website and _only for sections that are translated_.

## Primary Documentation

The primary documentation is written in English, and can therefore be found in `content/en`

## Translations

In order to present the website in another language there are several things you need to do:

### Translate the content

The new content simply goes in `content/<lang>`.  We recommend that the pages and file structure are the same as the English version.

### Update Site configuration

In the site configuration, either in `/config.toml` or in `/config/` folder, add corresponding entries or files for the new language.  For example

* Copy `menus.en.toml` to `menus.fr.toml` and translate whatever is needed into French

### Update the Theme

The underlying theme already supports i18n.  

The theme itself (in the [hugo-r3-theme repository](https://github.com/corda/hugo-r3-theme)) can be edited, but it is easier to take:

Copy [`/i18n/en.toml`](https://github.com/corda/docs-site/blob/master/themes/r3/i18n/en.toml) to (site) `/i18n/fr.toml` and then add the French translations.
